This is unfinished. It was a test suite workflow to enforce testing methodology when I consulted test automation. Generally, a tester would write have a test suite Gerkin. They could kick off a test run.
The test suite would then automatically execute the tests that have all of the statements automated and present the non-automated tests to be manually tested. The tester could use the site to track
and document tests it executes out of the non-automated tests.
